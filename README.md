# RelationTable
Given a file of relations, output a table showing all relations.

Currently this program takes in non-cost bi-directional relations and prints out a table. The goal is to turn it into something more useful where you can enter in any type of relation and
it will output a table representing them (or in the future, a graph that represents the relation).
